			<h2>Using DSSP data</h2>

			<p>DSSP provides an elaborate description of the secondary structure elements in a protein structure,
				including backbone hydrogen bonding
				and the topology of &beta;-sheets. The most popular feature is the per-residue assignment of secondary
				structure with a single character code:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>H = &alpha;-helix</li>
				<li>B = residue in isolated &beta;-bridge</li>
				<li>E = extended strand, participates in &beta; ladder</li>
				<li>G = 3<sub>10</sub>-helix</li>
				<li>I = &pi;-helix</li>
				<li>P = &kappa;-helix (poly-proline II helix)</li>
				<li>T = hydrogen-bonded turn</li>
				<li>S = bend</li>

			</ul>

			<p>The full DSSP output is provided in two formats. The legacy DSSP format was origianlly designed for
				structures that were in
				PDB-formatted models. Now, 40 years later, the PDB format has become obsolete as it cannot capture the
				large structure models that
				modern structural biology methods can provide. The mmCIF format is the data format of choice for
				structural biology as it has no
				size limitations for structure models and it can hold extensive annotations and metadata. DSSP now
				writes its data straight to these
				mmCIF files by default. The legacy DSSP format can still be written but only for structure models that
				fit.</p>

			<p>The first few lines are taken from the input model file, then some general statistics about the model and
				hydrogen bonding
				are given. The histograms describe the distribution of sizes of secondary structure elements. For
				instance, this structure has
				three helices, one short one consisting of 4 residues and two longer ones of 16 and 17 residues. Note
				that beta sheets are described
				as a collection of ladders, rather than strands. Ladders can be seen as two strands together with the
				hydrogen bonds as the rungs
				of the ladder. More formal definitions are given in the Kabsch and Sander paper.</p>

			<p>Below is a brief description of the data columns. More details are described in the Kabsch and Sander
				paper.</p>

			<h3>RESIDUE</h3>
			<p>Two columns of residue numbers. First column is DSSP's sequential residue number, starting at the first
				residue actually in the model set
				and including chain breaks; this number is used to refer to residues throughout. The second column gives
				the numbering as is used in the
				structure model 'residue number','insertion code' and 'chain identifier'; these are given for reference
				only.</p>

			<h3>AA</h3>
			<p>One letter amino acid code, non standard residues are marked as <em>X</em>. CYS in an SS-bridge are
				marked by a lower case letter. So when cysteines
				are bridged, then the first bridged cysteine in the sequence and its partner elsewhere in the sequence
				are marked <em>a</em>. The next bridged cysteine,
				that is not yet marked, and its partner are both marked <em>b</em>, etcetera. Unbridged cysteines remain
				marked as <em>C</em>.</p>

			<h3>S (first column in STRUCTURE block)</h3>
			<p>The one-letter summary of secondary structure, intended to approximate crystallographers' intuition,
				based on columns 19-38, which are the principal
				result of DSSP analysis of the atomic coordinates. More details in the Kabsch and Sander paper.</p>

			<h3>BP1 and BP2</h3>
			<p>Residue numbers of the first and (if available) second beta bridge partner. The letter marked the B-sheet
				that contains the bridges.</p>


			<h3>ACC</h3>
			<p>Water exposed surface in Angstrom**2. <em>Note:</em>The values for solvent exposure may not mean what you
				think:
			<ul>
				<li>Effects leading to larger than expected values: solvent exposure calculation ignores unusual
					residues, like ACE, or residues with incomplete backbone.
					it also ignores HETATOMS, like a heme or metal ligands. Also, side chains may not have all atoms
					explicitly modeled.</li>
				<li>Effects leading to smaller than expected values: in complexes, e.g. a dimer, solvent exposure is for
					the entire assembly, not for the monomer.
					Also, atom OXT of c-terminal residues is treated like a side chain atom if it is listed as part of
					the last residue.</li>
				<li>Unknown or non-standard residues are named X on output and are not checked for the expected number
					of sidechain atoms.</li>
				<li>All explicit water molecules, like other hetatoms, are ignored.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>N-H--&gt;O etc.</h3>
			<p>Hydrogen bonds; e.g. -3,-1.4 means that this residue (i) has its HN atom H-bonded to O of residue i-3
				with an electrostatic H-bond energy of -1.4 kcal/mol.
				There are two columns for each type of H-bond, to allow for bifurcated H-bonds. <em>Note:</em>The marked
				H-bonds are the best and second best candidate. The second best
				and even the best (in rare occasions) may be unrealistically por H-bonds.</p>

			<h3>TCO</h3>
			<p>The cosine of angle between C=O of residue i and C=O of residue i-1. For &alpha;-helices, TCO is near +1,
				for &beta;-sheets TCO is near -1.
				These values are descriptive and not used for structure definition.</p>

			<h3>KAPPA</h3>
			<p>Virtual bond angle (bend angle) defined by the three C&alpha; atoms of residues i-2, i, and i+2. Used to
				define bends (structure code <em>S</em>).</p>

			<h3>ALPHA</h3>
			<p>Virtual torsion angle (dihedral angle) defined by the four C&alpha; atoms of residues i-1, i, i+1, and
				i+2. Used to define chirality (structure code <em>+</em> or <em>-</em>).</p>

			<h3>PHI and PSI</h3>
			<p>The peptide backbone torsion angles as described in the IUPAC standard</p>

			<h3>X-CA, Y-CA, and Z-CA</h3>
			<p>Just a copy of the C&alpha; atom coordinates in the structure model</p>

			<h2>DSSP data in mmCIF files</h2>

			<p>The mmCIF-formatted DSSP output caries the same information as the DSSP format but in a more scalable way
				and with a formal description caputered in
				an mmCIF dictionary. It is designed to be machine readable. Developers who create software to read these
				annotations can use our
				<a href="https://github.com/PDB-REDO/dssp/blob/trunk/mmcif_pdbx/dssp-extension.dic"
					target="_BLANK">extension to the mmCIF dictionary</a> on GitHub.
				<em>Note:</em> For sake of speed the solvent accessibility is not calculated by default when using mmCIF
				output. The command-line switch
				<code>--calculate-accessibility</code> can be used to switch this feature on.
